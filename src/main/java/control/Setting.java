    The ability to have an unrestricted setting, where the value can be any user-chosen value
    The ability to have a semi-restricted numeric value, where the event/command pre-defines a range
    The ability to have a semi-restricted string value where the event/command pre-defines this
    The ability to have a restricted string value where the event/command pre-defines all values possible

    It should also contain a way to register a default value.
